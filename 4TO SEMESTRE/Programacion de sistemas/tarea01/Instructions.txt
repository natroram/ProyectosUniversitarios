The files has some simple errors. Try to compile the packages of these three files with the linking process, and see the errors.
Once you fixed them, create a Makefile that compile each .c file 
seperatly (like  Makefile3 example showed in class).

Generate a dump file with the optimazed decompilation of the exec file, and give it a look.

Submit your solution in a zip file (remember not to attach compiles
or exec files)
